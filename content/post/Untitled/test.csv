8700 Bluecreek Cove
The Estates of Barton Creek

An expansive single-story home situated on an oversized lot at the end of a private cul-de-sac, unlike any other residence currently offered for sale in the Barton Creek area.  The architectural style and floorplan is specifically designed for the land it sits on, never to be replicated.  Originally showcased in the 1984 Parade of Homes, hosted in the once deemed and continues today ""The most exclusive neighborhood in Central Texas,"" the Estates of Barton Creek.  Developed by former governor, John Connally and Lt. governor Ben Barnes, the vision was to respect the natural habitat and trees, providing discriminating homeowners an extraordinary environment of luxury living with home-sites unprecedented in size and every home being unique to the other.


This magnificent property has been reimagined by a local architect, dedicating over two years planning and implementing the new vision, transforming the structure to highlight and refine architectural details.  The layout has been adjusted in certain areas for maximum openness and enhancing views to the outdoors with additional windows.  Enlarging the kitchen makes it sufficient for any chef, homeowner or caterer, including commercial-grade, gas and electric appliances.  A total of five built-in refrigeration units, two dishwashers and an outstanding custom vent hood make this kitchen perfect.  All finishes are impeccable throughout and include all the conveniences and technology a discerning homeowner expects for a 2018 build.  No detail has been missed.  
An exceptional home with soul.


The wide-open spaces inside and out, beautiful views of the pool, fountains, cabana and guest house, with vistas of the entire property, are a perfect setting for any event, such as a family cook-out, large dinner or intimate evening for two.  This home will accommodate your every need.

It's a lovely home on 1.13 acres, 7 miles from downtown Austin in a highly-desirable neighborhood where every home has almost an acre or more.  It has a warm and inviting feel.  It's a half a block away from the community pool, park, basketball courts, tennis courts, and several play areas for the younger one's.  It's minutes through the neighborhood to the local Waldorf School.  It has a lot of charm, starting with the antique bricks in the courtyard.  They were rescued from a building in downtown Austin; likely dated to the 1800's.  It has a nice flow and the kitchen breakfast area is open to the family room.  It has nice, large bedrooms with double closets.  The 4th bedroom we use as an office has a single set of closets.  The back yard is a wonderful oasis to enjoy with $40,000 of improvements on your 1+ acre w/ Tiki Hut an Bar, a hot tub, a fire pit, a wisteria arch, and the cutest little old-fashioned out buildings.  The Chicken Coop and thatch-roofed run are made complete with the Himalayan Silkies with feathers all the way to their toes.  There's a large old tennis court on the back of the property 120 feet wide x 61 deep.  We've discussed many ideas to utilize this space.  It's concrete w/an asphalt top that would be suitable for a greenhouse/microgreens food growing operation.  We considered putting up a fence and charging to park RV's there.  We thought about putting up sail shades and a suitable setting for tiny houses in an Air BnB effort.  While the HOA is voluntary we certainly hope that any use will be in keeping with the neighborhood, although you COULD build a mother-in-laws quarters or a whole ""nother house on the lot with this one.  I personally like the microgreens idea and can even give you a starting contact to sell to. We do have a copy of the survey.  More pictures coming.  We're still making things pretty for you.  BTW:  Good neighbors too!  We are REQUESTING that serious parties provide us with a mortgage qualification/approval letter before scheduling a showing.  This is for security reasons as well as to limit wasted time on ""curious"" people.  This is our home so thank you for your understanding.  If there is a reason this can't be provided please give us a call and we'll take it from there.  Thank you.  P.S. With sun porch the square footage is actually 2460 and it's 1.13 acres.

Neighborhood Description

Clarksville has the best of both worlds: It's a quaint, quiet Austin neighborhood with unique homes, diverse residents, and plenty of history, but it's in the center of the city and only a stone's throw from downtown's many attractions. Clarksville is far from suburbia; it's an eclectic urban hub in the heart of the city so it attracts people who love to be in the mix of things. It's a hip area and is home base for much of the city's creative crowd (there are many art galleries in Clarksville). If you enjoy walking, you will love strolling through Clarksville's hilly streets. Clarksville Park and West Austin Park are two small parks in the neighborhood, and each contain wading pools that are open in the summer. Clarksville is full of cafes, coffee shops, and restaurants.",Single Family,30.27606010437012,-97.76024627685548,2,False,1912,3,3963.0,6.0,16,4.0,4

Homes in Travis Country West were constructed between 2002 and 2007 with builders DR Horton and Morrison Homes.

Sited on a .72-acre corner lot in Davenport Ranch, this handsome 5BR/6.5BA, 5576sqft Texas limestone home offers ample room for family and entertainment. Lofty ceilings tower over bright spacious living areas accented with hardwood and travertine floors, Calcutta marble kitchen, and custom lighting, cabinetry and ironwork. 

Stately glass and iron Cantera entry doors open to reveal a formal living room with a floor-to-ceiling fireplace, built-in cabinetry and a wall of brilliant windows. An exquisite stairway lined with custom iron balusters leads up to a large second-story landing that looks down over the living room from above. The room is awash in natural sunlight and the massive windows frame a relaxing view of the manicured backyard landscape.  

Sharing a sizable open concept with a warm family room and a sunlit breakfast area, the recently-remodeled kitchen features extensive cabinets topped with rich Calcutta marble. Underfoot are travertine floors and a considerable amount of custom cabinetry offers lots of storage space. Chef's conveniences include an over-sized farmhouse sink, a large pantry, stainless-steel appliances, dual ovens and a 5-burner island gas range.  More backyard views can be seen through large picture windows in both the family room and breakfast area, which also offers direct access to the covered patio and yard.

Enjoying its own access to the wide covered patio, the private master suite touts an on-suite bath with a barreled ceiling, a pedestal jet tub, large shower, dual vanities and a grand walk-in closet with built-in drawer stacks.  Another bedroom on the opposing wing of the main level has a walk-in closet and a bright bay window with front yard views.  Upstairs is a huge bonus room with a wet bar and access to an iron-railed balcony that overlooks the gorgeous backyard and pool.  The remaining bedrooms of the main house are also located on this second level, one of which features a secret door that leads to an enchanting, custom-designed child's playroom with built-in table tops and toy storage.

Outside is a lush family playground of thick lawns, manicured hedges, limestone walkways and wrought-iron fencing.  Located just off the covered patio and adjacent to a substantial outside fireplace, is a grill top set in Texas limestone.  Further back, beyond the playscape and trampoline pedestal, is an incredible entertainment area with an inviting pool and hot tub.  Friends and family will enjoy gathering under the enormous poolside cabana with a fireplace, summer kitchen, wide screen TV, and a convenient half-bath. Steps away from the pool/entertainment area is a detached one-bedroom guesthouse with a sizable living room, full bath and a well-appointed kitchen. This private casita would be ideal for in-laws, teens or a home business. 

Comfortable, spacious and impeccably well-constructed, this beautiful home also features an office, a wine room and a gym.  Other highlights include plantation shutters throughout, custom wainscoting, designer light fixtures, centralized audio, Internet home surveillance, new HVAC, a circular drive and an attached 3-car garage. Plenty of off-street parking, close to everything Austin and inside the coveted Eanes ISD.

14573,austin,"Sumptuous finishes define this home. It's everything you need and nothing you don't.  With its idyllic location in the Aldridge Place Historic District, this unique and rare Spanish Revival bungalow was designed and built in 1928 by distinguished architect Hugo Kuehne.  Kuehne, founder of the University of Texas School of Architecture, who was responsible for such noted works as the Austin History Center, the Commodore Perry Hotel, and the Ritz Theater.    The sellers purchased the home in 2011 and undertook a very extensive restoration and remodel throughout 2012/2013.  The project was designed by architect Ann Tucker of Studio A Group and built by Garland Turner of Woodeye Construction, with the goal of returning the home to its former glory. Unfortunately, there wasn't much left to work with when the owners took possession in 2011; doors and mantles had been removed, windows were oddly placed, and bathrooms had been cheaply redone. Despite these setbacks, the home has always remained a neighborhood favorite. The current owners took a lot of time and thought to make decisions to recreate a timeless home that will live on for the next 100 years.     The extensive, 10 month remodel included all new electrical, plumbing, roof, HVAC ductwork and returns, major foundation and leveling work, subfloors, fully-insulated walls/ceilings, level 5 wall finish, custom millwork, kitchen, baths, lighting, steel doors, windows, fireplace and chimney, flooring, and built-ins.    The home is located in one of the most walkable parts of town. The University of Texas, Blanton Museum of Art, Central Market, Wheatsville Coop, great restaurants including Texas French Bread, El Patio, Via 313, Black's BBQ, Hopfields, Thai Kitchen, Counter Cafe, Sip Pho all are within a few minutes walk.

The finishes are exhibited in intricate tile recesses and the mind bending imagination is revealed when long, glass walls of the family room disappear to make the room transform into a part of the outdoors.  The view beyond that opening stretches peacefully out over the pool, through the hills and out to the sparkle of Lake Austin.    The private backyard and the green expanse of the majestic view demand that the architecture take advantage of the magic there.  The creative use of glass figures prominently in the home's design.  Two story walls of windows in the living room are dramatic.  Curved glass windows that echo the round breakfast area are playfully beautiful and the two glass walls in the family room that can be rolled back is astonishing.     In the dramatic entry, huge iron and glass doors with a massive arched transom open to a two-story space flanked by Cantera columns and a stone stairway with scrolled iron railing that twists gracefully to the upper floor. Matching scrolled ironwork railings overlook the two story living where recesses outfitted with cove lighting allow for dramatic presentation of artwork. Stone flooring meanders into the dining, with a dropped ceiling detail that mirrors the shape of the room and provides framework for the chandelier light.    The heart of the kitchen is a commercial Thermador stove with double ovens and 6 gas burners.  This gorgeous workhorse is the center of a cook's dream space beautifully outfitted with herringbone stone backsplash, richly stained alder cabinets and thick granite counters.     A welcoming wet bar with beautiful cabinetry and a wine refrigerator is an excellent stop between these wonderful spaces or on the way to huge patios, covered verandas and the enviable view that is worthy of a deep breath and a sip while your blood pressure falls after a day at the office.    Scrollwork iron matching the inside stair rails borders the patio out to the lovely pool and level lawn that ends in a spectacular view.    Mirrors hang floating in front of large windows in the master bath providing excellent light and striking originality of design.  A jetted oval tub under large windows, a generous shower recess with intricate tiled designs, and the luxury of body sprayers complete this spa bath.  The walk-in closet is filled with furniture quality built-ins and great, well thought out storage.    Bedrooms upstairs have access to beautiful baths and balconies with higher, even better views of the gentle slopes of the Hill Country and Lake.    There is no corner of this home that is not designed and finished with beautiful detail and luxurious feel.

The development at 3103 Fontana sits on a narrow lot that backs onto lower East Bouldin Creek. The property is located in the heart of 78704 straddled by South Congress and South 1st streets and just a 9 iron from Dawson Elementary School.

The site now includes double driveways with access to covered parking for both units. At the back of the ground floors, huge living rooms with vaulted ceilings open onto private decks that look down on the creek.



Walking from your undercover parking to the front door and beyond, each unit at 3103 Fontana features an enormous ground-floor master bedroom, walk in closet and en-suite at the front of the house.

Multiple access points to the kitchen and livingroom provide a feeling of ample space with amenities, laundry and bathrooms accessible along the building’s shared wall.

The modern kitchen and island open into a shared dining and living space with vaulted ceilings, state of the art fixtures and a gateway to the outdoors. The deep, wide and similarly vaulted deck includes views of the creek and steps down to the manicured garden landscape.



Fontana’s stairwell opens into a custom entertainment room with console, TV and cable hookups. The space has natural light pouring through the windows and easy access to both additional bedrooms and the stairs.

Towards the street sits the second master with a full ensuite bathroom. The windows looks directly west making it the best room in the house for sunset-lovers.

At the other end of the top floor, the third bedroom overlooks the garden and East Bouldin Creek. Barn-style doors throughout add a rustic charm.

Noticing 3103 Fontana from the street, you will admire clean lines and a crisp color palette. Colors of the walls and trim are reversed on the covered parking areas which also feature electric car charging stations.

Manicured driveways and gated landscaping provide a serene stroll to the front door of either unit. High-end grasses and flora provide a low-maintenance visual appeal.



The back of the property falls away towards East Bouldin Creek. This elevation changes means when standing in the backyard, you’re looking up at the deck and living room of the units.
