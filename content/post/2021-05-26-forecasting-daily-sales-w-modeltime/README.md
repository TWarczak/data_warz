For this blog post, I use the `{modeltime}` package to
forecast 3 months of daily sales in Q1 for a young ‘Superstore’ company
selling furniture, technology, and office supplies. The forecast can 
then be used to make decisions about supply-chain orders, warehouse 
inventory, and if/when new employees are needed to meet predicted 
sales demand after the holiday season.
