My name is Todd Warczak, pronounced WAR-ZAK, and I recently completed my PhD in 2020 genetically engineering safer-to-eat crops that accumulate less arsenic from the soil. The most fullfilling streches of my thesis work involved implementing new statistical tools in R to analyze and visualize my plant genomics data. Now I am eager to move into data science full-time where I can grow my abilities within the amazing R community. 

I currently live in White River Junction, VT. Looking to relocate to a major U.S. metro area. You can find me on Twitter and GitHub. This blog was built in RStudio using {blogdown} and Hugo-academic; deployed on Netlify.
