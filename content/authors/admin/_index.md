My name is Todd Warczak, pronounced WAR-ZAK. I’m a mid-level Data Scientist and experienced R developer. If you need help with data analysis, engaging clients with dashboards or interactive apps, building predictive models, automating data driven reports, or just creating impressive data visualizations - I’m your guy!

I completed my PhD in 2020 from Dartmouth College, genetically engineering safer-to-eat crops that accumulate less arsenic from the soil. The most fulfilling part of my thesis work was building custom analysis tools and visualizations for my plant genomics data.

I moved to California in 2022 to work for Bio-Rad Laboratories as a Data Scientist II, building Shiny apps for a team of scientists to interact with their data in the cloud, developing ddPCR and NGS analysis pipelines in R, overseeing Bio-Rad software development for a Non-Invasive Prenatal Test (NIPT) kit our QX600 machine. 

Sadly, In January 2023 our NIPT project did not pass feasibility stage. In March 2023 Bio-Rad performed a large round of layoffs and my position, along with others on the NIPT team, were terminated. But I’m excited to start new projects with a new team!

I currently live in Pleasanton, CA. Looking for opportunities in the Bay Area or Seattle.
