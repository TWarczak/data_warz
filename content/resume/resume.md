## Work Experience {.divider}

### Molecular Biologist
#### 2015 - 2020
* Engineered genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genes controlling arsenic tolerance in plants. Determined variation in the expression of Arabidopsis gene *NIP1;1* on 4th chromosome as the major genetic factor for tolerating arsenic. All data analyzed in R.
* Developed the first cell-type specific expression map in R for plant genes involved in arsenic acquisition, efflux, sequestration, etc. for root epidermal, cortical, and endodermal cells.
* Built first RNA-seq pipeline for research lab to analyze gene expression of 25000+ plant genes using R. Transitioned multiple lab data analysis workflows from excel to R, including PCA, qPCR, Gene Ontology analysis, and statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.).
* Presented research to local community members, government officials, and other stakeholders as a representative of the Dartmouth Toxic Metals Superfund Research Program.
* Mentored 2 undergratuate scientists.

## Recent Projects {.divider}

### Forecasting Daily Sales with Modeltime
* Forecasted 3 months of daily sales utilizing the {modeltime} package in R to help ‘Superstore’ company selling furniture, technology, and office supplies manage supply-chain and inventory decisions in Q1 (data source: Kaggle). [blog](https://toddwarczak.netlify.app/post/modeltime/)
* Exploratory data analysis and 11 models tested. 6 {tidymodels} workflows tuned for individual forecasts and weighted ensemble (Support Vector Machine/Neural Network-AR/Random Forest/Prophet-XGboost) forecast.

### TidyTuesday
* Weekly twitter project focusing on cleaning, wrangling, summarizing, and arranging a new dataset in R to produce a single chart. Typically using {ggplot2} and {tidyverse} tools. Shared via #TidyTuesday. [github-TidyTuesday](https://github.com/TWarczak/TidyTuesday)
* Mario Kart 64 World Records - Visualization of cumulative days individual records are held by players.
* Survivor - Visualization showing Myers-Briggs Type Indicator personalities of all show contestants vs. the winners.
