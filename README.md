## data warz

Welcome! Before I knew data science was a thing I got addicted to R while working on my PhD. The relationship started as just a ggplot fling; looking to spice up my plots. After a few wild nights on stackoverflow I cut things off with excel and committed to a tidy-life pursuing hex stickers.

This blog was built to document my dive into data science, to showcase some side-projects, and hopefully give a little back to the amazing #rstats community. Constructed using {blogdown} with Hugo-Academic theme and deployed through Netlify.  Critiques and suggestions are welcomed.
